## 👨‍💻 Work experience

### Test Design Professional

`Siemens s.r.o., Bratislava – (2024 - Today)`

Today, I am working at Siemens on a project where we are developing firmware for controllers that control thermostats in office buildings. Our stack is in Python, and we work a lot with Linux.

### Automation QA Tester

`Indra Avitech s.r.o., Bratislava – (2023 - 2024)`

In early 2023, I returned to Indra Avitech as an automated tester. I write tests in python using pytest and playwright. My responsibility is to write test cases in Gherkin, write new tests and maintain existing ones. I also do manual testing and I am the quality owner of the product. 

### Senior QA Tester

`NER System s.r.o., Bratislava – (2020 - 2023)`

My hobby is Ruby on Rails and when I got the opportunity to work in a company where they develop RoR application, I jumped at it. In a small team I take care of testing as the only tester. That's why automation is important, and I wrote a set of regression tests in Cypress. We have apps for iOS and Android for managing employee attendance, which I am also testing.

### Test Manager

`Indra Avitech s.r.o., Bratislava – (2018 - 2020)`

After a year and a half I got the opportunity to lead a team of testers at Avitech and I took it. I was responsible for meeting team goals, communicating with other departments and taking care of team members. I participated in interviews with candidates and was in charge of on-boarding new colleagues. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to go fully remote team, and it was my responsibility to transition the team to a different way of working.

### QA Tester

`Indra Avitech s.r.o., Bratislava – (2016 - 2018)`

I started working at Avitech as a QA Tester. My responsibility was to test web and desktop apps. I also had to maintain the test suite and write test scenarios for new features.

### Web developer

`Freelancer, Trnava – (2012 - 2016)`

As a free spirit, I longed for independence and I was working as a freelancer for almost 4 years. I held the role of developer, tester, and project manager. I used WordPress, HTML and CSS for web development. I gained experience as an administrator on various hosting providers.
