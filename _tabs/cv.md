## 👨‍💻 Work experience
### Web developer

`Freelancer, Trnava – (2012 - 2016)`

As a free spirit, I longed for independence and I was working as a freelancer for almost 4 years. I held the role of developer, tester, and project manager. I used WordPress, HTML and CSS for web development. I gained experience as an administrator on various hosting providers.

### QA Tester

`Indra Avitech s.r.o., Bratislava – (2016 - 2018)`

I started working at Avitech as a QA Tester. My responsibility was to test web and desktop apps. I also had to maintain the test suite and write test scenarios for new features.

### Test Manager

`Indra Avitech s.r.o., Bratislava – (2018 - 2020)`

After a year and a half I got the opportunity to lead a team of testers at Avitech and I took it. I was responsible for meeting team goals, communicating with other departments and taking care of team members. I participated in interviews with candidates and was in charge of on-boarding new colleagues. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were forced to go fully remote team, and it was my responsibility to transition the team to a different way of working.

### Senior QA Tester

`NER System s.r.o., Bratislava – (2020 - Today)`

My hobby is Ruby on Rails and when I got the opportunity to work in a company where they develop RoR application, I jumped at it. In a small team I take care of testing as the only tester. That's why automation is important, and I wrote a set of regression tests in Cypress. We have apps for iOS and Android for managing employee attendance, which I am also testing.
